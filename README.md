Practical explorations of data science and generative AI concepts from the IB2AD0 module.
# IB2AD0 – Data Science & Generative AI

This repository contains practical explorations of core data science and generative AI concepts covered in the IB2AD0 module. The work focuses on machine learning workflows and the use of generative AI in business and consulting contexts.

The notebooks in this repository were developed as part of the learning activities associated with the module and are intended to support the accompanying individual assignment. They demonstrate engagement with key stages of a data science project, as well as reflection on the practical limitations and implications of applying these techniques in real organisational settings.

The repository prioritises clarity of explanation and reflection over model complexity, aligning with the applied and conceptual focus of the module.
