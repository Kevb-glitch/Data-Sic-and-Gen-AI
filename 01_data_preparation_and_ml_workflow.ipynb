## Overview

This notebook explores a basic machine learning workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, and model training. The aim is to demonstrate how data preparation decisions influence model performance, particularly in applied business contexts.
### Reflection

This workflow highlights how even simple modelling approaches rely heavily on data quality and preprocessing decisions. While this example uses a relatively clean dataset, real organisational data is often messier, which would increase the complexity of this stage significantly.
