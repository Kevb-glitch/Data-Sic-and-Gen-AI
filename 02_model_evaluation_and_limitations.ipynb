## Model Evaluation and Limitations

This notebook focuses on evaluating a simple machine learning model and reflecting on its limitations when applied beyond a classroom setting.
### Limitations and Practical Considerations

Although the model performs reasonably on this dataset, the results may not generalise well to larger or more complex datasets. Issues such as overfitting, bias, and data drift would need to be carefully managed in a real business environment.
